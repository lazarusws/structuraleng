<p>My name is Alazar Woldeyohannes. I am currently enrolled in master’s program  in Structural Engineering in the School of Mechanical, Aerospace and Civil Engineering at the University of Manchester.
 I am working on a dissertation  project “Web-based calculator for Structural Engineering problems”  as a partial fulfillment for the degree of MSc. </p>

<p/>Apart from my academics, I am an easy going person who loves to have fun and do sports. I also like to travel and explore new places. </p>
